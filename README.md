## Objective
The main goal is to demonstrate the complete process of creating an interactive Excel dashboard to help businesses analyze sales performance and customer behavior.

## Tools
The project leverages Microsoft Excel's capabilities for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Key functions such as XLOOKUP, PivotTable, PivotChart, INDEX, MATCH, and IF are extensively used to organize, analyze, and visualize the data. Additionally, slicers and timelines are incorporated to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

The customers table contains customer details such as ID, name, email, phone number, address, city, country, postcode, and loyalty card status. The products table includes product details like ID, coffee type, roast type, size, unit price, and profit.
