# Coffee Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project entails building a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze coffee sales data. 

## Objective
The main goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of creating an interactive dashboard in Excel that can help businesses analyze sales performance and customer behavior.

## Tools
The project leverages Microsoft Excel’s capabilities for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. 

Excel’s XLOOKUP, PivotTable, PivotChart, INDEX, MATCH, and IF functions are extensively used to organize, analyze, and visualize the data. Additionally, slicers and timelines are incorporated to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises three main tables: orders, customers, and products. The orders table includes order ID, order date, customer ID, product ID, and quantity. The customers table contains customer details such as ID, name, email, phone number, address, city, country, postcode and loyalty card status. The products table includes product details like ID, coffee type, roast type, size, unit price, and profit.
